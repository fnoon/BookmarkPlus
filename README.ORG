* Frederick Noon's Emacs Bookmark+ Repo

This is my collection of Drew Adams' Bookmark+ elisp files.
Their canonical respository is on [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BookmarkPlus][EmacsWiki]], from which these
are downloaded by my get_bm+_files script.  There doesn't seem
to be any more convenient way of obtaining them -- so this is
what I've come up with.

** Installation

Something like the following should be in ones Emacs init file:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/sw/third/emacs/bookmark_plus")
  (require 'bookmark+)
