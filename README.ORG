* Frederick Noon's Emacs Bookmark+ Repo
This is my collection of Drew Adams' Bookmark+ elisp files.
Their canonical respository is on [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BookmarkPlus][EmacsWiki]], from which these
are downloaded by my get_bm+_files script.  There doesn't seem
to be any more convenient way of obtaining them -- so this is
what I've come up with.
